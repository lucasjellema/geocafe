# Geo Cafe - exploring geo data and tools & technologies for working with it

In the Geo Cafe we look at tools for visualizing geo data - including Datawrapper anm Google MyMaps, for creating and manipulating geo data - such as geojson.io, mapshaper and mapwarper - and at a tool for doing most of that as well as analyzing geo data: QGIS. We discuss geo data formats and public geo datasets. We end with a look at Leaflet, a JavaScript library for integrating real world interactive maps in web applications.
